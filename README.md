# WolfSSG

WolfSSG is a Static Site Generator built using Wolfram Language.

It supports basic templating of front pages and blog post pages. The final build director is a hybrid file structure where the front pages reside in the root directory and the blog posts are placed in the posts directory.

## Todo
- [ ] Add logs in the build script
- [ ] Add methods to handle CSS and images
